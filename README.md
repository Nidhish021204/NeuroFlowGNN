# NeuroFlowGNN
Introduces a novel graph-based residual state update mechanism (REST) for real-time EEG signal analysis in applications such as epileptic seizure detection. It combines graph neural networks and recurrent structures to capture both non-Euclidean geometry and temporal dependencies within EEG data
