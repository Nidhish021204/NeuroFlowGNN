# REST: Graph-Based Residual State Update Mechanism for Real-Time EEG Analysis

## Overview
REST (Residual EEG State Tracker) is a novel deep learning framework that models EEG signals as temporal graphs, using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combined with residual state updates. It is designed for real-time seizure detection and classification, capturing both spatial and temporal dependencies within EEG recordings.

## Key Features
- Graph-based modeling of EEG electrode connectivity
- Residual State Update module for efficient sequence learning
- RNN-based temporal modeling of node representations
- Real-time seizure detection and classification

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/arshiaafzal/REST.git
cd REST
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
